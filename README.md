# DC Central Lunch Fund

Mobile-first website to address the issue of school lunch debt within the District.

## Todo

Short term:
	* Wire it up with Stripe API, Venmo API, or some service that allows an easy transfer of 		funds
	* Already reached out 10-20 principals in the DC area, as well as
		Ashley C. Ford @iSmashFizzle
		Kristina Arwood in Evansville, Indiana
		Jill Draper in Kingston, New York
		Amy Larcinese - school principal in Herminie, Pennsylvania that received huge 			donation from stranger to pay off lunch debt
	So discuss details further with any key people once the week begins.

Long term:
	* Pair with organizations like Amazon, Starbucks, etc. (any company with big gift card 		situation) and implement a point system - $100 in donations gets you $10 at Barnes & 		Noble
	* Build an actual mobile app to accompany the website (and convert website to mobile-		first)
	* Implement Twillio/Slackbot to send texts (optional) like “Hey, would you like to pay for 		a student’s lunch today?” and provide a link to donate $2
