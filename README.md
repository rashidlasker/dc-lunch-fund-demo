# DC Central Lunch Fund

Mobile-first website to address the issue of school lunch debt within the District.

## How we built it

We used the MEAN stack to implement the web application. We used the Nessie API to connect directly with bank accounts and improve ease of use. We used python to read .csv files and rapidly scrub information. We used Amazon Web Services to host our app with Cloudfront.

## Challenges we ran into

* Connecting the back-end with the front-end

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

* Implementing a multi-factor authenticated user registration system within the MEAN stack

## Todo

Short term:
	* Wire it up with Stripe API, Venmo API, or some service that allows an easy transfer of 		funds
	* Already reached out 10-20 principals in the DC area, as well as
		Ashley C. Ford @iSmashFizzle
		Kristina Arwood in Evansville, Indiana
		Jill Draper in Kingston, New York
		Amy Larcinese - school principal in Herminie, Pennsylvania that received huge 			donation from stranger to pay off lunch debt
	So discuss details further with any key people once the week begins.

Long term:
	* Pair with organizations like Amazon, Starbucks, etc. (any company with big gift card 		situation) and implement a point system - $100 in donations gets you $10 at Barnes & 		Noble
	* Build an actual mobile app to accompany the website (and convert website to mobile-		first)
	* Implement Twillio/Slackbot to send texts (optional) like “Hey, would you like to pay for 		a student’s lunch today?” and provide a link to donate $2
